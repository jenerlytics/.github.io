##**<span style="color:blue">Sample Q & A</span>**
***


- **Question** :One of our tenants recently requested that we paint the inside of her apartment. She has threatened to do it herself and deduct the cost of the paint from the rent if we do not  have it painted within the next two weeks. Is she legally able to carry out her threat?
- **Answer** :Unless the condition of the walls rendered the premises uninhabitable, the owner is under no obligation to paint the unit at the request of the tenant.

- **Question**:What is the most useful information on the tenant’s application for collection purposes?
- **Answer** :The most useful for locating former residents are the Social Security, driver’s license and license plate numbers. For collection on judgments, current employment and bank account records are the most valuable.

- **Question**: What is an estoppel certificate? The owner of the property I manage requested that each of the tenants sign an estoppel certificate. I did not want to appear unknowledgeable.
- **Answer** : An estoppel certificate is a document signed by the tenant certifying that the major terms of the lease are true and correct. Estoppel certificates are sometimes required during the sale of rental property so the buyer knows that the tenant understands and agrees to the major terms of the lease.

- **Question**: Can we legally restrict the number of automobiles our tenants can park on the property? There is open parking but some of our tenants have four or five cars.
- **Answer** : You have the right to control the number of automobiles that the tenant may park on the property.  Clear guidelines should be given in writing and equally enforced.

- **Question**: A tenant’s child broke a glass shower door. Can I charge the tenant for the repair of the door?
- **Answer** : The tenant is liable for any damage done by its invitees, guests or other occupants of the premises. The tenant should have to pay for the repair of the door.

- **Question**: New tenants signed our lease and paid the first month’s rent. Now they want to get out of the lease. They did not take possession.
- **Answer** : When the tenant signs a lease, they are bound by the terms whether or not they change their mind later.
