As an example, above graph shows the next 6 month rental rate forecast, based on machine learning model and data available. some of the comments below:

- We build deep-learning model from historical data as well as other data such as the trends of future economic factors and indicators, and able to forecast confidently the rental rate changes in the next six months.

-  As we can see, in at least next 6 months, the rental rates are going to decline a little bit, which is a good news to tenants, but not so good for landlord. More must be done to save costs and improve property management efficiency.

-  Among many others, one of the answers to the challenge of real property management is the embrace the digital technologies, digital marketing and combination of digital technolgies with the maturity and lean and agile systems.
