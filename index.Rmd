Whoever you are, tenant or landlord, to understand current real estate market conditions and future trends are very important. Landlord can make more money by properly pricing the rental properties based on market conditions, and renters can save money by finding better cost effective rental homes. With the rapid growth of predictive data analytics and machine learning, data driven decision making has prevailed elsewhere.

The acurate future forecasts provides decision support material facts for landlords and tenants.
